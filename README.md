# ProjectDependencyGraph
console application. problem: you're embarking on some project. the project's work can be described through it's steps (.do 'this', then do 'that'), through efforts estimate and there's a relationship between these steps (can build the first floor only after having the foundations). all these are described in an Excel worksheet. but it's hard to visualize this and see easily set integration points or calculate the critical path. solution: given an Excel file that describes work in some project the application generates a graph that describes the work found in the Excel. the graph is written to a .pdf document.
